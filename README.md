# Overview
My Dog Ate My HW is a productivity app, where the user creates tasks that need to be completed. In order to complete a task, the user must upload an image of the task being done as "proof" of completion. Once the task is completed, it becomes converted to food that can be fed to the dog for it to live and grow. As time goes on, the dog's health decreases, and tasks must be completed in order to keep the dog alive.
